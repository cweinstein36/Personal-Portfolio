            <p>
                Hi! My name is Nicholas Weinstein, but you can call me by my nickname Cole. As of fall 2023 I am starting my coding journey, soaking up new knowledge with the ucf coding bootcamp. I was born in Orlando, where I grew up and found my passion in online video games and computers. I earned my Associates of arts degree in general studies at Seminole State College, when I realized what I learned wasn't what I wanted to do. After retempering my outlook and experience, I dove into this journey into another job field! As much as I throughly enjoy my time inside, I also love being in nature. I grew up in scouts, so being outdoors and taking up leading roles is almost natural for me as well.
